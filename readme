Title: FPM Calculator

Description: 
To calculate the amount of flashes per minute for a flashing light source based on only 4 flashes. This only works on red light frequency. If want to change the colour frequency, can learn about the RGB sensor and adjust appropriately.

Usage:
The device will be able to detect flashes from 5-10 cm away.
Just point the device to the flashing light, let it record 4 flashes and value should appear. Adjust distance appropriately.

Recommendation:
Remove the 4 white LED surrounding the sensor as it can interfere with the wavelenght of light from flashing light.
